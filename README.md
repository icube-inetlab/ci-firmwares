## IoT-LAB Continuous Integration System Firmwares

This repository contains the instructions and firmware source codes to be used
with the continuous integration system of IoT-LAB.

Depending to the hardware operating software support, firmwares are currently 
based on two OSes :

* **RIOT**, see [riot/README.md]
* **Arduino**, see [arduino/README.md]

For Arduino, you might need to install the Arduino IDE into your
system, you can use `make -C arduino install-arduino-ide`
